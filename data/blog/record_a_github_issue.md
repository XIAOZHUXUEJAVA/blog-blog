# I successfully submitted a GitHub issue to a 10000+ stars projects

The issue are as the the following:

https://github.com/krahets/hello-algo/issues/479

The process of how I submitted the GitHub issue is quite unique for me:

At first, I discovered a bug in projects's code, and I conducted a test in my local environment. So I submitted a issue to the projects. But the main author of the projects did not attach importance to it.

During the process, I actually had a moment of doubting whether I was wrong.

**Finally, I believed myself.**

Recently, another coder discovered the bug as same as I discovered before, leading to the issue being reopened~

After this, the another author of the projects fix the bug.

**All in all, believe yourself, believe yourself, and believe yourself.**
