## modules1.rs

The function `make_sausage` is declared as public, so it can be called outside the module `sausage`. But `get_secret_recipe` is not declared as public, so we can not access it outside the module.

```rust
mod sausage_factory {
    // Don't let anybody outside of this module see this!
    fn get_secret_recipe() -> String {
        String::from("Ginger")
    }

    pub fn make_sausage() {
        get_secret_recipe();
        println!("sausage!");
    }
}

fn main() {
    sausage_factory::make_sausage();
}
```

## modules2.rs

In Rust, the `pub` keyword is used to declare the access permission of a function, variable or module as public, which means they can be accessed and use from outside other modules.

```rust
mod delicious_snacks {
    // TODO: Fix these use statements
    pub use self::fruits::PEAR as fruit;
    pub use self::veggies::CUCUMBER as veggie;

    mod fruits {
        pub const PEAR: &'static str = "Pear";
        pub const APPLE: &'static str = "Apple";
    }

    mod veggies {
        pub const CUCUMBER: &'static str = "Cucumber";
        pub const CARROT: &'static str = "Carrot";
    }
}

fn main() {
    println!(
        "favorite snacks: {} and {}",
        delicious_snacks::fruit,
        delicious_snacks::veggie
    );
}
```

## modules3.rs

```rust
use std::time::{SystemTime, UNIX_EPOCH};

fn main() {
    match SystemTime::now().duration_since(UNIX_EPOCH) {
        Ok(n) => println!("1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC was {} seconds ago!", n.as_secs()),
        Err(_) => panic!("SystemTime before UNIX EPOCH!"),
    }
}
```
